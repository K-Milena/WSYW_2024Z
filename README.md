# Hello! - WSYW 2024Z
This repository is used to track my progress in preparations for labs in WSYW (Introduction to Embedded Systems) as well as the results of self-learning. It currently contains (so far) small projects written for the SMT32F411E-DISCO board. I am using version 1.16.1 of the STM32CubeIDE software.

Some of the versions of excersises are "hidden" in previous commits (I could simply copy them, might do it later).
